# Hello-World

Hi Youniverse, whats Good with you today?
In this world of abundance, I refuse to be limited
Greatness is a state of mind, it is executed with every breath, thought, intention and actioned.
Words as mere words unless actioned. Knowledge without action is redundant power. 
You can read every spiritual or holy book in this world, unless you action what you have read this is knowledge rendered useless. 
Be more than just what you read, become living power by action.
